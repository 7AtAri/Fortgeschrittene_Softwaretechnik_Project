## Clean Code Cheat Sheet

### 1) Boy scout rule
leave the code cleaner as you found it!

### 2) conventions
follow existing coding conventions
to help others read and understand the code faster!

### 3) DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself! 
Rather use functions and call them various times.

### 4) Tell, don't ask
Tell an object what to do, 
instead of asking for its inner state and then act on it.

### 5) YAGNI
Only implement what is really necessary.
