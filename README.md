Project: Online Appointment/Reservation Bot

This project will set up a bot for making (an) appointment(s)
and/or reservation(s) on a website.
It will include using webscraping, as well as clicking on Links and
filling online forms automatically by the bot.
Eventually there will be a time sceduler for the bot, so
it is only active in a configurable repetitve timeframe until the task is done.

e.g. possible use cases: 
- Booking appointment at Bürgeramt when available dates match preferences
- Booking a table at a Restaurant when avaibale dates match preferences
- Booking a flight when prices are cheap and dates match preferences
- Booking a train ticket...

What you will need to install the project:

install the following libraries via pip: 
1) selenium
2) requests
3) ...

download and install a selenium webdriver for your browser:
https://pypi.org/project/selenium/

Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, 
which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. 
Make sure it’s in your PATH, e. g., 
place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
